This repository was created so that I could use vundle to install the required calutil.vim file for [VisIncr](https://github.com/vim-scripts/VisIncr).

I used the 3a version of this file rather than the 3b version I found elsewhere because it uses '/' as a date separator.

I don't plan on updating this repository, so feel free to use or fork.
